                <p>Yes, this character has the same name as a character in <i>Hollow Knight.</i> Moving on!</p>
                
                <p>I was stuck in an art block for a while; I finished a birthday gift, I made some original drawings, and I've been updating this website. Once August began, I couldn't come up with anything new.</p>
                <p>I wanted to practice with perspective, rooms, and furniture, but nothing looked right and I grew frustrated because of it. I was getting better with posing and I had good references to work with, but I wasn't inspired.</p>
                <p>I worked out of the block by writing and researching interior design, but I wanted to draw something new. I've drawn a lot of <i>SPACE</i> characters and I couldn't think of anything for the others, so I drew a second moth character, much like Cithera.</p> 
                <p>Her name is Dryya and she's based on the Rosy Maple moth. I was inspired to draw her after talking with someone on <i>Discord,</i> and I had pictures of the moth in another tab since May before I got to work.</p>
                <p>I had a feeling that a Rosy Maple Moth would have a sweet personality to match its appearance. I made Dryya look like a pop star and she was <i>supposed</i> to have a microphone, but I couldn't fit it in without covering her face. Serendipity writes the plot, I guess.</p>
                <p>I plan to revisit this character later. I didn't shade her or try anything too fancy because I was more focused on working through my art block. I may redesign her as a result, but I'm not worried about that right now. For now, I want to see if I can experiment with furniture/perspective/backgrounds a little more. Maybe I can actually pull it off this time.</p>

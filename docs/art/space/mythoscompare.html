                <p>…A lot of pictures, isn’t there?</p>
                
                <p>Between 2018 and 2019, I made a design for a character named Mythos. I never knew why, but there was something about her that I disliked. She looked too plain, and I didn’t like how the veiled skirt looked on her. In June, I gave her a redesign; she wears tights with stars on them, black slippers, a matching dress, and a grey veil. I also decided to swap her skin and hair colors, which was for the better in my opinion.</p>
                
                <p>The oldest drawing of Mythos was drawn on <i>Inkscape,</i> and the newest was drawn on <i>Clip Studio Paint.</i> I made this to reflect the evolution of my art style since 2018, but I’ve improved even more since I made this six months ago.</p>
                
                <p>I feel like if I drew her now, she’d have more detail in her clothes, eyelashes, and hair, with better arm and leg proportions. Still, it’s amazing how much work evolves with time, and I can’t wait to see how it continues to evolve!</p>

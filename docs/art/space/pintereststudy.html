                <p><b>These were previously undated drawings I posted on <i>Instagram</i> in 2020.</b> I have found when I posted them, so I am archiving them here. As a result, these are my present thoughts on the drawings.</p>
                <p>I was not confident in my artistic abilities when I drew these. <i>Pinterest</i> was my main outlet for pose references, and even then, I struggled with proportions. I remember thinking about changing Chlora's hair around this time, as her previous lost treasure has a different hair style. That, and her star is on her tie instead of a pin. As for Aqua? she hasn't changed much.</p>
                <p>I have a shadow drawing from time period that was a part of the pose study, but I grouped her drawing with an Electra drawing instead because the Electra drawing was undated and both of their pose references were from <i>Danganronpa</i> games. Hence, she has a different entry.</p>
                <p>I stopped using <i>Pinterest</i> a few months after completing these. Why? because I couldn't find poses and clothing designs that were free to use. A lot of references I saved were from <i>Deviantart,</i> <i>Wattpad,</i> <i>Pixiv,</i> etc. that were likely posted without the artist's permission. I found that some of the group photo references I liked the most were originally from accounts that <strong>didn't</strong> want people using them. I drew the line when an outfit reference I saved was taken down because the person who reposted it infringed the artist's copyright.</p>
                <p>Moral of the story? Check the description of a post/the artist's terms of service before picking a reference. As for the artist who designed the clothes? I now follow them on <i>Twitter.</i></p>

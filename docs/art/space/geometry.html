        <h1>Impossible Geometry</h1>
        <img src="../../images/space/geometry.PNG" width="575" oncontextmenu="return false;"/>
                <p>I wasn't sure if this would look good as I was drawing this, but I was surprised with the feedback I got from it.</p>
                <p>I was inspired to draw this after listening to "Impossible Geometry" by <i>The Stupendium and Chi-Chi.</i> It's about being obsessed with a game called "Beat Saber," but the artwork for the single and the composition gave it a futuristic sound. I wanted to capture it the best I could, but with my characters instead.</p>
                <p>I chose Pyro and Aqua since they fit the "red left, blue right" design of the game. I used the same lightning brushes here that I used for Leo, and it makes the background really stand out. The glowing suits were planned from the start, but they took a while to get right, Pyro's especially.</p>
                <p>Some other notes for this piece are that I wanted to give Aqua shapes different from Pyro's on her side to reflect their differences. This was my first piece to use <i>Clip Studio's</i> color burn layer effect, which is why they appear darker. It looks good, but it required eight gradient layers. I'm figuring out what they all do, which will take a while because there's a lot of them.</p>
                <p>I hope this piece was a good homage to the song, and if you want to listen to it, you can listen to it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWc5sVpiNOQ">here.</a></p>

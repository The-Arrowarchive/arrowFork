                <p>Pyro and Electra are different in every way I can imagine; a humble soldier, a genius trickster, a hand-to-hand fighter, a long-ranged specialist. The only thing they have in common is the friends they share.</p>
                
                <p>I look back on these two and it’s crazy for me to think that both of them got redesigned this year. I had issues with their previous designs, so I was relieved with how well these turned out. I added a phoenix-inspired star emblem to Pyro’s shirt and redesigned his gauntlets, while I designed Electra’s spear and gave his clothes more detail (though ironically, I forgot his goggles. I’ll make sure to include them in the future)</p>
                
                <p>I wanted to practice drawing their forms and see if there was anything I could add, both of which I accomplished! Gradients were fun to experiment with too, as the “half and half” background turned out better than I thought. I drew Shadow, Aqua, and Chlora in a similar style, so I can’t wait to share my thoughts on them!</p>

                <p>Do you ever have that one character or one idea you want to expand upon, but aren't motivated to expand upon it? For me, Chlora is that character.</p>
                <p>Don't get me wrong, I like her design, but I don't draw her as much as the others. I don't know why that is, but I wanted to draw her again.</p>
                <p>She's one of the few characters I haven't drawn at all this year, and I wanted to rectify it. I made a few changes to her outfit and touched up her hair while giving her a casual outfit in the third picture. Her tie lacks the star emblem it usually has, but I don't include the star in practice doodles.</p>
                <p>Maybe I don't draw her as much because she doesn't have as much personality as the others? I don't know, but I used this drawing to practice with folds in clothing. I haven't decided on her skirt length, but I have a feeling it will be the same length as Aqua's.</p>
                <p>Maybe if I check my notes for her and redesign Jade, I can give her more spotlight. That said, she was front and center in my relic song piece, so I'm not sure why I draw her less. I'm happy with her current design, but I want to fix that. Someday, somehow, she'll be in more of my work.</p>

        <h1>Chlora's Room</h1>
        <img src="../../images/space/chloraroom.PNG" width="750" oncontextmenu="return false;"/>
                <p>The last time I designed a room, it was May of this year. I've wanted to design the environments for some of my characters, but I was struggling with it for most of the year. It's still not my strong suit, but I'm getting better with it, if this piece is any indication.</p>
                <p>This piece started with me redesigning the house the SPACE characters stay in and organizing the layout using <i>The Sims 4.</i> I built everyone's rooms, took screenshots of them, and I decided to draw Chlora's room first.</p>
                <p>I see Aqua and Chlora having a sisterly relationship, with Aqua acting as a cool big sister to Chlora. I designed more casual outfits for the girls, and I wanted to show how they interact with each other. Aqua doesn't mind sitting on the floor, and she's enjoying chatting with a girl who isn't as moody as Shadow.</p>
                <p>I love this piece, but it's not without its flaws; I struggled cleaning up the background and couldn't blur it because of how many layers there were; The perspective for the dresser and bedside table looks off, and I forgot a few small details (Chlora's glasses and the stars they wear), but I think part of it was because this piece was taking up enough time and I was ready to start something new.</p>
                <p>I plan to keep this design for her room, but I'll touch it up in the future. I want to add a design to the rug, which I tried to add but couldn't. I like the sunrise painting I did and I'm happy I put my relic song drawing as the other portrait. I like the sheets and pillowcase, but I may touch them up. I'm gonna add blinds to the windows, add lights on the walls, and add more to the desk.</p>
                <p>I haven't drawn a room in a while, but I want to keep trying and improving. I hope my effort shows here. Also, if anyone knows what the plush on her desk is a reference to, you're awesome!</p>

                <p>I designed Nihilus in May, with the intention of her being a sweet, but terrifyingly powerful magician, especially when she's angry.</p>
                <p>I wanted to capture the aggressive part of her personality and her role in the chess knights. She is the bishop, a master of dark magic with monstrous power and a short fuse. Her hat and scarf bend to her will, and are some of her strongest assets. Her strength DOUBLES when her buttons are pressed, but she loses focus and becomes more reckless as a result. Her skills are a double-edged sword, making her unable to think clearly while making her a force to be reckoned with. This makes her a powerful asset normally and the team's Godzilla Threshold (according to <i>TV Tropes</i>) at her strongest. </p>
                <p>I did my best to capture her aggressive side, from the sharp-toothed grin and menacing glare to the ears on her hat turning into devil horns. It was great revisiting her after five months, and I think I set the foundation for drawing her in the future with this piece.</p>
                
                <p>I hope you enjoy, and Happy Halloween!!!</p>

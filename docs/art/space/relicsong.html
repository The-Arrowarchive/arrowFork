        <h1>Relic Song</h1>
        <img src="../../images/space/relicsong.PNG" width="750" oncontextmenu="return false;"/>
                <p>I had a conversation with a friend on <i>Twitter</i> a while back about <i>Pokémon.</i> We talked our ears off about the series, but talking with them gave me some inspiration. That spark was to dress my characters like <i>Pokémon</i>, and the ideas came naturally.</p>
                
                <p>I chose Chlora because like many of my characters, I haven't drawn her since September. I drew her as a Meloetta, but then I remembered: it has two forms, Aria and Pirouette. I drew Chlora in Aria Forme, but I wanted to include the Pirouette. My red main character is male (Molo and Ember don't know her,) so I drew Aqua instead. She is a dancer, so it fits her character.</p>
                
                <p>I wanted to draw a bonus comic showing that they were dressed like this because Aqua invited Chlora to a rehearsal with Chlora saying that she won't grow her hair out like this again, but I didn't have time. This was fun to draw, I'm happy with the spotlight, and Aqua's hair, though it was hard to work with, looks decent.</p>
                
                <p>I don't know if I'll draw my characters like this again, but it was a fun experiment. The next time I draw Chlora, she will be in her regular clothes.</p>

                <p>I finished this drawing at the end of June, and I didn't show it until mid July. Let me explain.</p>
                <p>July 13th 2020 is when I joined <i>Twitter.</i> It was the start of a new era; being more confident in my work, improving my skills, meeting new people, and making others smile. So long as I could do that, the numbers didn't matter.</p>
                <p>Over the last year, I became a better artist and a better person. I've been doing what I love while building a digital portfolio from scratch. Now, I have over 100 followers, I've witnessed so many talents, and I'm more confident than I was a year ago.</p>
                <p>I've rambled enough, time to discuss the piece. I realized that my quartet was composed of complimentary colors early on: blue and orange, purple and yellow. I made a rule not to put compliments next to each other, and it turned out better than I expected. Each character had their own challenges to work with: wings, extra arms, long hair, and glowing crystals. I had to be careful with the layers, and I kept duplicates of the outlines in case I messed up.</p>
                <p>There's a lot of subtle details too. The gradient matches the characters, Kessh≈ç's crystals and the sparkles glow, Lylatt's gem is shaded better, Aqua has her star pin (which was absent previously), and Cithera's design has changed.</p>
                    <p>I could go into more detail, but I think I've said enough. I'm grateful for one year of being on <i>Twitter,</i> and I'm excited for what will happen next. Here's to another year of art, fun, and good vibes!</p>

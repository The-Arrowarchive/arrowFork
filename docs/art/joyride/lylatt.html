            <p>A few years ago, I had an assignment where I had to design an a creature with the characteristics of three or more animals; a hybrid, if you will.</p> 
                
                <p>I wanted to try that challenge again, but I wanted them to be a biped instead of a quadruped; in otherwords, I wanted them to be anthropomorphic. </p>
                
                <p>After working on-and-off for over a week, this was the result; a hybrid shapeshifter with characteristics that don't clash. The hererochromia and asymmetrical top were added at the last minute, and all of Lylatt's components are listed below:</p>
            
<ul>
             <li>Kitsune (multiple tails, shapeshifting abilities)</li>
             <li>Griffin (the wings and talons)</li>
             <li>Chimera (to an extent)</li>
             <li>Sheep</li>
             <li>Cat</li>
</ul>
            <p>Designing her was as fun as it was difficult; incorporating her elements and designing a color palette that didn't clash took the most thought, especially since she isn't bound by reality. It was fun designing her, but I feel like it will be a while before I try this challenge again.</p>

                <p>Art block is no fun. After drawing the robots, I couldn't come up with any ideas for almost two weeks. I had more work to do, less free time, and the free time I had needed to be used carefully. I decided that if I couldn't come up with anything to draw, I'd have more luck with writing. I spent about a week writing for my characters before being inspired to draw again, and this was the result.</p>
                <p>A lot of the writing I did was for <i>Joyride</i>, and it shows; the first idea that came to my mind involved Lylatt, and her characterization inspired it. Her home life isn't the greatest and she deals with a lot of stress because of it. Spending time with Leo and Lacertae provides respite for her, but when she wants to be alone, she'll fly into the sky to watch the sun rise or set. It's peaceful to watch from above, since no one can disturb her up there.</p>
                <p>Part of what I love about writing is that it helps me develop my characters and find good situations to put them in. It allows me to build their world and show more of their personalities something I couldn't do before. </p>
                <p>My last note here is that a lot of the piece has colored lines. I've been experimenting with line color for a few months, and while I'm pleased with the results, it takes a lot of time and I can never color the lines completely. I see this working for glowing objects, but I want to try different approaches with colored lines. I'm going to study how other artists, games, and shows use them and see if I can incorporate some of what I learn into my style. Learning from others never hurts, and I want to keep making my art the best it can be!</p>

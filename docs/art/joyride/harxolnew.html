        <h1>Harxol Revamped</h1>
        <img src="../../images/joyride/harxolnew.PNG" width="575" oncontextmenu="return false;"/>
                
                <p>Well, this came out of nowhere.</p>
                
                <p>I have a few projects I'm working on, but if inspiration strikes, I write the idea down or create a file for it that I'll resume later. That wasn't the case here. I wanted to redesign Harxol for a while, but I didn't know where to go with him. When I drew him again, more ideas began to surface and caused me to shelve my current project. I'll resume that soon.</p>
                <p>Next to Lylatt and Cithera, Harxol is one of the most unusual characters I've designed. He is human-like, animal-like, and robotic all at once but never gravitates towards a specific category. He's an enigma, and that's the best way I can describe him.</p>
                <p>I think that is what made him so challenging. The changes I gave him are small but significant; he glows more, his horns resemble insect mandibles, He has airplane wings with built-in engines, and his chestplate is more defined. It is similar to how he previously looked, but fits his newer build and predominantly features his crystal heart. It was barely visible before, and I wanted to change that. Other minor changes include adding a mouth and giving him yellow sclerae to make his eyes stand out.</p>
                <p>His design lines up with my current style, but if you visit his previous design and like how he looked before, I don't blame you. I don't know exactly what it is, but I've always been fond of him; he's a mystery that I can't solve, and I don't know if I want to. I guess that's one of the joys of character creation.</p>

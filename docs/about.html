        <p> Hello everyone! My name is Rachel, and I am the owner of the Arrowarchive. I am a twenty-year-old art student, writer, and an aspiring showrunner. Multimedia was a big part of my life; from animated shows and films to video games, I was fascinated by the stories people told, how creative they were, the effort that went into them, and how passionate everyone was about their work. It was their passion that inspired me to create my own worlds, and it's my goal to inspire others the same way they inspired me.</p>
        
        <p> Before college, I interned with a printing company in my hometown. I helped design, pack, and print over 2,000 shirts for my school's biennial charity event. I began taking digital art seriously around this time, using <i>Inkscape</i> and <i>Adobe Illustrator</i> on my computer before getting my first art tablet and a copy of <i>Clip Studio Paint.</i> I continued using CSP after switching to an iPad in the summer of 2020, which I use to this day.</p>
        
        <p> Since starting college, I have enrolled in several digital art and coding classes. I constructed my first website out of markdown in late 2020, and I started learning HTML in early 2021. I have constructed a second website since then and this is my third. It is a reimagining of my first website, built from the ground up with a layout that matches my personality. In late 2021, I co-founded a club that specializes in film production and website development. I am currently one of the leaders for web development and my goal is to help others build digital portfolios while learning techniques I can incorporate here.</p>
        
        <p> Outside of drawing, writing, and coding, I love watching shows and playing games with friends. I am critical of the content I watch, so I will dedicate a section of my website to my favorites. My list of favorites can be viewed <a href="rachelspicks.html"> <b>here</b> </a></p>
        
        <p> Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy browsing the archive!</p>

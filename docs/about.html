        <p> Hello everyone! My name is Rachel, and I am the owner of the Arrowarchive. I am a ninteen-year-old art student, writer, and an aspiring showrunner. Multimedia was a big part of my life; from animated shows and films to video games, I was fascinated by their creativity. It is my goal in life to inspire others through the same mediums that inspired me.</p>
        
        <p> Before college, I interned with a printing company in my hometown. I helped design, pack, and print over 2,000 shirts for my school's biennial charity event. I began taking digital art seriously around this time, switching from <i>Inkscape</i> and <i>Illustrator</i> to buying an art tablet and <i>Clip Studio Paint</i>. </p>
        
        <p> Since starting college, I have enrolled in several digital art and coding classes. I constructed my first website out of markdown in late 2020, and I started learning html in early 2021. At the time of writing this (March 1<sup>st</sup>, 2021), I am constructing a second website for a project and this will be my third. This is a reimagining of my first website, with a customized layout that matches my personality. </p>
        
        <p> Outside of drawing, writing, and coding, I love binging shows and playing games with friends. I am critical of the content I watch, so I will dedicate a section of my website to my favorites. My list of favorites can be viewed <a href="rachelspicks.html"> <b>here</b> </a></p>
        
        <p> Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy browsing the archive!</p>
